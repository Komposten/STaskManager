# Taskmanager
The aim of this project is to create a task manager similar to the one in Windows 10 but which works on multiple platforms. Additionally the functionally will be extended with several new features to make it even better.

Extra functionality includes:
* Historical memory/CPU usage of all processes
* Text filtering for the process list
* A list of processes that died recently
* The graphs can be adjusted to display different time spans using an interactive timeline  
* The graphs will display their values at the mouse cursor position
* Read/Write speed graphs are logarithmic to make them easier to interpret
